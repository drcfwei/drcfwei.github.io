## Overview
We connect research in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, psychology and mathematics to tackle a wide range of problems across the field of intelligent vehicles and dynamical systems. Our group aims to develop innovative dynamic models and control algorithms to characterise and improve the behaviour of intelligent vehicles and mechanical systems in relation to safety, comfort, acceptance, naturalness and trust, provide fundamental insights into human-centric intelligent systems, and build next-generation of intelligent vehicles as well as robots to address challenges in human-robot interaction, decision making and control, human factors and transportation.

<strong style="color: #52adc8;">Decision-making of Intelligent Vehicles.</strong><br>
Within the complex and interactive environment, automated vehicles (AVs) not only need to avoid the dynamic and static obstacles, but also need to cooperate or negotiate with other road users. One critical challenge is that the AVs cannot socially behave like rational human drivers when interacting with other road users, especially in interactive urban environments engaged with heterogeneous road users. Our study is to develop human-centric decision making and control algorithms for AVs in relation to trust, acceptance and naturalness.

  <strong style="color: #52adc8;">Human-Robot Interaction.</strong>
Although automated vehicle studies are moving forward at a fast pace, this study is to investigate how humans interact with robots and automated vehicles. The future connected and automated vehicles, as well as robots, will co-exist with humans. There should be many challenges arising due to the uncertainty of human behavior and the limited understanding between humans and robots or intelligent vehicles. Our research in this area focuses on investigating human factors, predicting human behavior, and developing human-centric autonomous systems that can co-exist and cooperate with humans.

<strong style="color: #52adc8;">Dynamics and control.</strong><br>
Our research in dynamics  is to develop dynamic models to characterise the dynamics behaviour of mechanical systems,  particularly nonlinear systems. Through exploring the nonlinear properties of these mechanical system, we can optimise designs of the sytems, and improve the accuracy of mathematical modelling. WIth the developed dynamic systems, we also develop controllers to improve their performance in relation to comfortability, stability, safety and energy economy.
